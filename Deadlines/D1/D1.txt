~Idea Proposal
	-Our objective to to create a motion activiated alarm with network connectivity. To reach this objective we plan
 to use a Raspberry Pi 2 model b, an infrared motion detector, and a buzzer alarm. Ubuntu will be installed on the Pi
 and the Gpiozero library will be used to interface with the motion detector and buzzer. We made these design choices
 because our larger goal was to design a single component of an in home security system. We already have the Pi and the
 sensors and cables will arrive from Amazon by Febuary 26th. The total for the sensors and cables was $18.04.
